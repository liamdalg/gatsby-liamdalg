# Introduction

This is some filler text, written in Markdown. It has been transformed into nice HTML with `gatsby-transformer-remark`, alongside some other plugins. Look, some code!

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  if (0 == 1) {
    return -1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

`Câ€ºint x = 5;`

## Subheading

Some regular old boring text. How about _italics_? Or **bold text**?

We can even write equations such as $x^2 = 1$, powered by KaTeX!

$$
a \wedge b \implies c \iff f \vee g \\~\\
\sum_n^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$
