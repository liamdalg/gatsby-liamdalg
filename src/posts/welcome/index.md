# Introduction

Hey, my name is Liam, welcome to my website! This was built very very slowly with GatsbyJS (plus a bunch of plugins), and is hosted on Github Pages. I wrote this mostly to have a place to write that isn't social media, and also to actually put something into practice! I've been building it slowly over the past year due to procrastination, exams, and my hatred of the frontend. If you're reading this, hopefully it's finally done.
